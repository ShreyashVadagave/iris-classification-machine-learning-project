# Iris Flower Classifier

## Project Overview
The Iris Flower Classifier is a web application built using Python and Flask that classifies iris flowers into three species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. The application uses machine learning models to predict the species based on input features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

This project serves as an excellent introduction to machine learning and web development, making it suitable for beginners and enthusiasts alike.

## Features
- User-friendly web interface for inputting flower measurements.
- Real-time predictions of iris species using trained machine learning models.
- Display of relevant information including images and interesting facts about the predicted species.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Anaconda (optional, but recommended for managing packages)

### Steps to Set Up the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
